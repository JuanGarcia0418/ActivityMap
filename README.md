# Activity Map 7WS

A web page is a fundamental tool for any company, since it allows the dissemination of information and contents that make possible the knowledge and understanding of the target public. This tool also helps in the internal communication among the company's employees, facilitating the flow of information.

## Description

This project was done to deliver the final project (Capstone Project) of the Holberton School programming academy, made with the purpose of solving a need of a company that offers services on cybersecurity, so that their customers can have a map of activities where they can keep track of the process for which they hired the service.
